Sucrose : The actual food of plants which is deliveried into their each system via the road name Phloem.
Starch : Reserve for plants so they can use it when they dont make enough food through their main food production
system photosynthesis.

To make both starch and sucrose we need Triose Phosphate (TP, a simple sugar with 3 carbons) as the FIRST
ELEMENT. TP is generated from the Calvin Cycle.

STARCH SYNTHESIS is the process by which plants produce starch by converting glucose into starch. This conversion
happens by LINKING GLUCOSE MOLECULES TOGETHER TO FORM LONG CHAINS, starch. STARCH SYNTHASE is the
(adhesive liquids) enzyme which helps this linking.

But building anything from scratch is quite painful. So instead of linking glucose units from scratch, STARCH
SYNTHASE adds these Glucose Units at the tail of a preexisting Starch Chain.

So we need glucose at first or else how do we make starch? Let's make A-GLUCOSE : [ A(DP)-GLUCOSE ]

                                ADP-glucose = glucose 1-phosphate + ATP

            'ADP-glucose' of LEFT SIDE equation ends with 'glucose' and thats why the RIGHT SIDE equation starts
             with 'glucose'. Now first word 'ADP' :
            'A-P' = A-phosphate = 1-phosphate. So we got 'glucose 1-phosphate'. But still where is the 'ADP'? We
             add ADP in the form of 'ATP' with 'glucose 1-phosphate'. So at the end we got 'glucose 1-phosphate + ATP'
             at the right side.

The above reaction is IRREVERSIBLE because of an enzyme named 'Inorganic Pyrophosphatase'. Of course it is
IRREVERSIBLE, we dont want to let go our freshmade A-glucose(ADP-glucose) right after making it.

Like this of course many more Glucose units will be produced.

Now that we got our glucose IN THE FORM OF 'ADP-glucose', we just link these glucose units to an already preexisting
Strach Chain/Molecules. Since we will use these 'ADP-glucoses' now, means these 'ADP-glucoses' are now ACTIVATED to be
used in building LARGERR STARCH CHAINS right? Thats why they are also known as 'activated nucleotide sugar' who are
ready to used.

This process of linking glucose_units(monomeric units) at the specific_end(nonreducing end) of the 
Starch_Chain(growing polymer) is also similar to how glycogen_is_synthesized(Glycogen Synthesis). Interestingly even
the mechanism of 'glucose activation'(the process 'ADP-glucose' produced/activated above) in Starch Synthesis is also
similar to that in Glycogen Synthesis.

        Types of Starch (Based on Branches. Branches are also chains made of glucose, but they are Side Chains)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Amylose     : Unbranched (because it loses(Amy'lose') its branches)
Amylopectin : Branched. Has branches and these branches/chains are created OFF THE MAIN BRANCH by SPECIAL CONNECTORS
              name '(α1-6) links'. So amylopectin has numerous (α1-6)-linked branches. And these CONNECTIONS/"(α1-6)
              links"" are made by an enzyme(branching enzyme) in chloroplasts, which is similar to the 
              enzyme_that_makes_branches_in_glycogen(glycogen-branching enzyme).

During ADP-glucose synthesis("ADP-glucose = glucose 1-phosphate + ATP"), an organic molecule called 'Ppi' is produced.
But then where is this Ppi here in the 'ADP-glucose = glucose 1-phosphate + ATP' equation? You dont see it? Because we
dont need it, we need only Glucose and hence this 'Ppi' obviously need to be BROKEN DOWN! Remember 
'Inorganic Pyrophosphatase'? Yeah he breaks down this Ppi using water(hydrolysis).

So taking into account the hydrolysis by inorganic pyrophosphatase on the Ppi produced during ADP-glucose synthesis,
the overall reaction for starch formation from 'glucose 1-phosphate'(the first element Glucose(ADP-glucose) is made)
is :

                        Starch(n) + glucose 1-phosphate = Starch (n+1) + ADP + 2Pi

Remember we dont directly create Starch from glucose, we add 'glucose' to already preexisting 'Starch' chain, thats why
at the left there is 'Starch' + 'gluose...'. You can assume it as :

                'n' size Starch + A Glucose Unit = 'n+1' size Starch + Additional stuffs(ADP + 2Pi)
