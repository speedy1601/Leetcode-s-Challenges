There are some questions helped me to strong the base :
| Question No | Description |
| :---------- | :---------- |
| 6 | How to keep all the `NULL VALUES` at the very `FIRST OR LAST` without sorting the other NON NULL values. |
| 9 | How to INNER `JOIN` based ON `ASSUMED columns` but behind the scene the original table's values remain as they are. Also `ITS VERY IMPORTANT TIME related Q` |
| 10| How do INNER `JOIN` actually works and we can do `split a dataframe into two and INNER JOIN them` with A SINGLE INNER JOIN on that dataframe |
| 12| How `group by` handles `NULL` values while grouping in Pandas, Polars, PostgreSQL |
| 13| In `PANDAS, POSTGRESQL` you can perform `AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS` on the `GROUPING KEYS` but in `POLARS` you can't |
| 14| Instead of `(df['active'] == 'Yes').sum() / df['active'].size()` just do `(df['active'] == 'Yes').mean()` |
| 16| If your information has inside 2 tables, JOIN them anyhow, even by their primary key, even if you don't get your desired mixed table because you can filter that mixed table and then get your desired table|
| 19| Sometimes in your `Pandas or Polars` code, before rounding up a Float value to CERTAIN DECIMAL NUMBERS, you might need to add `1e-10` to the FLOAT value first |
| 20| In `Pandas` if your solution needs only aggregrate functions like `count(), sum()`, use `agg()` even if you've to create some more columns, don't use `apply()` in this case. In `PostgreSQL` `GROUP BY` clause can access the `alias` created in `SELECT` as like `NEW COLUMN OF THAT TABLE` and can perform GROUP BY on that alias |
| 22| `THINK SIMPLY`. JUST CREATING A NEW COLUMN can save your time, optimize efficiency and just more creative. (`IMPORTANT TRICKY QUESTION`). And in `POSTGRESQL` you can't perform `NESTED AGGREGATE FUNCTION` during `GROUP BY operation` and also you can't do `player_id = MIN(player_id)` without using `player_id in group by` |
| 26 | In `PANDAS`, `groupby(by=.., as_index=False) .agg(..)` returns A DataFrame. So no need to do `reset_index` anymore unless necessery |
| 28 | How to `DELETE ROWS HAVING DUPLICATE ROWS i.e. keep only the PURE SINGLE ROWS`. In `PANDAS` you can use `agg()` without `group_by` |
| 29 | In `PANDAS` you can use `df['a'].min()` `FUNCTIONS` like this inside `query()` using `@`. Just a simple `REMINDER` that in `PANDAS, POLARS` if we filter the table after `GROUP BY(of course along with agg())`, means in `POSTGRESQL` we have to apply `HAVING` after `GROUP BY` because we filter on `GROUP BY` result with `HAVING` CLAUSE in POSTGRESQL.|
| 30 | In especially `POSTGRESQL` the FIRST VALUE of a column having the SAME VALUE, can be found using `MIN()` as they are all same values! Also with `(ARRAY_AGG(column_name)) [1]`. `round()` in `PANDAS` returns `8 for 8.5 but we need 9`, add `0.1 with 8.5 = 8.6 and round(8.6) = 9` AND for `8.4 = round(8.4 + 0.1) = 8 still as it should be`, so no need `np.ceil()` as `Pandas don't have ceil()`. Also a new way to use `assign()` in `Pandas` |
| 31 | Just like Question No `22`. `THINK SIMPLY. Think the COMPARISONS BETWEEN COLUMNS` AS `FORMULA` and if you need to CREATE A NEW COLUMN for that formula, then DO IT |
| 32 | Learn to use `eval() in PANDAS` and `sql_expr() in POLARS` to EVALUATE LARGE EXPRESSIONS/COMPARISONS easily |
| 33 | `VERY IMPORTANT` to learn what is `WINDOW FUNCTION`, thus how `OVER()` works with `PARTITION BY, ORDER BY` and no keyword, equivalent of `rolling()` and `diff(periods=2)` in `PostgreSQL`. Learn how to use `CUSTOM AGGREGATE FUNCTION` in `agg()`, access `temporary dataframe produced in the mid way` in `loc[]` in `Pandas` |
| 34 | In `PostgreSQL` how to select the `FIRST VALUE` for each `group of values` of a column using `DISTINCT ON(), FIRST_VALUE()`. Always Filter the data OR mark those uncessery data as NULL or any default value to work further smoothly|
| 35 | `VERY IMPORTANT` How to filter the One Row computing its `Index` (in sorted column) instead of filtering unnecessery rows by COMPARISONS. How to select the LAST VALUE for each GROUP in `Pandas` and `PostgreSQL`. In `POSTGRESQL` you can't use AGGREGATE FUNCTION in `HAVING CLAUSE` |
| 36 | How to convert a Row into a Column in `POSTGRESQL`. How to convert a Lazyframe's ALL VALUES into a Column and All Column Names into another Column using `unpivot()` in `POLARS` |
| 37 | Learn `ANTI JOIN` in `POLARS` using `join(how='anti')` and `POSTGRESQL` using `NOT EXISTS, LEFT JOIN`; how it works, how to know if your question can be solved using majestic `ANTI JOIN` |
| 38 | How to Swap Values with SORTING and learn more Efficient Logic. Learn Multiple If conditions in `POSTGRQSQL` |
